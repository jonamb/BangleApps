# Annoying Reminder

This simple app helps you to not forget stuff or tasks. It buzzes every few minutes (configurable) until deactivated. If ignored, it will just keep buzzing every x minutes. A widget is also shown when the app is active.

It can be activated either manually or daily at a certain time.

Manually starting/stopping the reminder is done by executing the app. While this is possible from the launcher, it is recommended to use a simpler way such as a swipe launcher or similar so it can be done quickly and without needing to look at the device. 3 shor buzzes mean the app is active and 1 long buzz inactive.

Use cases:
- Starts to annoy you every morning at 9 during the week and 11 at weekends to take medication. Much less intrusive than a mobile phone or similar devices.
- You are in the Zone and someone asks you to do something later. To make sure you don't forget it the moment they leave, you can simply activate the reminder.
